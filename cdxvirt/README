This directory is for placing cdx-build packages that can be kept separate from
an upstream buildroot.  The purpose of this is to make pulling in upstream
buildroot updates much easier, since your customizations will not touch any 
files also modified by buildroot changes.

cdxvirt/board        # For machine configs (*_defconfig files)
       /configs        # For machine configs (*_defconfig files)
       /fs             # For new filesystems 
       /package        # For additional packages and/or patching existing packages
       /patches        # For patching buildroot before build

It is recommended that the layout of the board, configs and package
directories follow the layout of the buildroot/ peers.

The package/patches directory should have subdirectories for each
package desired to be patched and patch files contained inside.
For example to add a patch to skiboot you would create:
    cdxvirt/patches/docker-engine/0001-example.patch
